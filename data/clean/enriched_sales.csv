Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 Ã¢ÂÂ¦,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop donÃ¢ÂÂt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.", https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/216Q4FqmZVL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg ,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Wireless-Adapter-Archer-T2U/dp/B07P681N66/ref=sr_1_54?qid=1672909126&s=electronics&sr=1-54,16,2024-01-18,2024,1,18,35184.0,2024-01-18

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2.

Secondary, Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands., Thirdly,as I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k. Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started, I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k. But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it. So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL, Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didn't like the 32 inch TV. Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy, but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15,740/- ( deal price 20,990... ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5,250/-) so technically bought it for 15740/- so I felt worth the risk and bought it. On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TV.That's my journey from searching to installation.Now coming to initial impressions.1- Picture - I'd say being a VA Panel, I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesn't come near to IPS panel display. But, yeah for an average user like me it's sufficient.2- Remote- It's simple, major apps hotkeys are given. YT, Amazon prime video, Hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. Simple and user friendly experience. It lacks hands free Google assistant.3- Sound- I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great, but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk, but no distortions nothing it's clear dialogues and Bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4- UI- It comes with Android 9 it doesn't matter to me as I'm a very average user so runs the show for me, I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5-Now to the main point as u can see my pictures, I see specially in Amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which I don't know whether it's problem with panel or application. Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason. If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6- Conclusion - Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000(bought for 17520/- including extended warranty for 2+2 years) bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it won't pinch me . So from my perspective I felt it's okay with some minor issues like sound. I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. If that is sorted I will be happy.Happy Diwali to team.,I have bought this tv at 18,990.00 and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc. VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.Pros:Android TVSoundColourCons:Remote,Loved the picture quality,Average picture quality but ok for this price,Worth for the cost.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 Ã¢ÂÂ¦,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop donÃ¢ÂÂt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/21jLkYGoSEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-LINK-T3U-Wireless-MU-MIMO-Supports/dp/B0859M539M/ref=sr_1_160?qid=1672909131&s=electronics&sr=1-160,86,2024-09-15,2024,9,15,257914.0,2024-09-15

THE TV IS STILL GOING STRONG - ALL THE GOOD POINTS MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ARE STILL TRUE AND VERY HAPPY WITH THE TV.IT'S AS IF ONEPLUS HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS! AFTER RECENT FIRMWARE UPDATES, THE ISSUES I HAD MENTIONED HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED.1. WE CAN NOW ARRANGE AND MOVE APPS (YOUTUBE, NETFLIX) AS PER OUR WISH ON THE HOME SCREEN ITSELF. I AM FINALLY ABLE TO PUT YOUTUBE FIRST AS IT IS THE MOST USED APP FOR MY TODDLER.2. THERE IS NO MORE WIFI DISCONNECT ISSUE NOTED EARLIER.3. PRIME VIDEO STILL SHOWS ERRORS SOMETIMES. THOUGH I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH THE APP AND NOT THE TV.STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TV!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH IN PURCHASING THIS TV AS THERE WERE MIXED REVIEWS FOR IT. HOWEVER, AFTER USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING ARE MY OBSERVATIONS:GOOD:1. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS FANTASTIC. THERE IS NO LAG WHILE WATCHING/FORWARDING 4K/8K VIDEOS.2. I SAW A YOUTUBE REVIEW WHICH SAID ITS BRIGHTNESS WAS LOW COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS - THE BRIGHTNESS IS MORE THAN YOU WOULD EVER NEED FROM A TV. I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO RUN IT ON FULL BRIGHTNESS TILL NOW, UP TO 40 WORKS FOR ME. FOR MY TODDLER TO WATCH RHYMES, I SET BRIGHTNESS TO 0, AND EVEN THEN IT IS MORE THAN NEEDED.3. THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT SAID THE SOUND QUALITY WAS AVERAGE AND YOU NEED A SOUNDBAR. I DISAGREE - I HAVE WATCHED MOVIES WITH UP TO 50 SOUND AND THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A 1000 SQFT HALL.4. VOICE COMMAND - IT IS QUITE ACCURATE AND I AM ABLE TO CHANGE NURSERY RHYMES FOR MY TODDLER WHILE WORKING IN THE KITCHEN WHICH IS AROUND 15 - 20 FEET AWAY.5. BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE TV FROM APP IS ALSO A VERY USEFUL FEATURE - NO NEED TO LOOK FOR REMOTE. BEING ABLE TO CAST FROM THE APP ALSO HELPS A LOT. IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF EVERYTHING ON PHONE (NOT JUST PICTURES AND VIDEOS) COULD BE CAST USING THE APPNOT SO GOOD:1. IF THE TV GOES TO SLEEP/SCREENSAVER FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES,A. IT OFTEN GETS DISCONNECTED FROM WIFI - HAVE TO RESTART IT AGAINB. PRIME VIDEO FAILS TO RESUME - DISPLAYS ERROR - AND HAVE TO RESTART THE TV AGAINC. ON THE HOME SCREEN, YOU CANNOT REARRANGE APPS TO HAVE YOUR PREFERRED APPS FIRST. YOU CAN DO IT IN APPS WINDOW WHICH IS USELESS AS YOU NEED TO NAVIGATE TO IT FIRST - EASIER TO NAVIGATE TO YOUR PREFERRED APP IN THE HOME SCREEN ITSELF.,ONLY CONS TILL NOW GOT, FAST MOVING OBJECT LOOKS BLURR, WHICH WAS KNOWN BEFORE BUYING BY OTHER USER REVIEW, BUT I GOT THIS TV IN 32 K,AO OVER ALL SATISHFIED,ONLY MINUS THAT TOO CRITICAL IS THE INSTALLATION SERVICE PROVIDER.THE PRODUCT IS TO INSTALLED BY V CARE INSTALLATION SERVICES PROVIDER.THE INSTALLATION SERVICE PROVIDER IS A TOTAL WASTE AND NOT RESPONDED PROPERLY.ACTUAL DATE OF INSTALLATION WAS ON 21.02.22 BUT WAS ONLY DONE BY THE SERVICE PROVIDER ON 27.10.22.THE EXECUTIVE WHO ATTENDED THE INSTALLATION IS A TOTAL WASTE PERSON AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE TO THE CUSTOMER.HE BEHAVED VERY RUDELY.THE INSTALLATION SERVICE PROVIDER IS A TOTAL DAMAGE AND WASTE.

The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don't know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sSPp4pkYL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-163-8-inches-Android-65U1S/dp/B095JPKPH3/ref=sr_1_492?qid=1672909149&s=electronics&sr=1-492,80,2024-10-11,2024,10,11,5599920.0,2024-10-11

Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared on-screen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTI'm using a JBL soundbar with sub-woofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable (not supplied), and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.  I can't comment on the built-in TV Speakers, because I haven't used them.PICTURE QUALITYThere are lots of presets for the screen, including Natural, Cinema, Gaming, etc., and you can also set a customised screen to your own liking.  The picture quality is excellent, every bit as good as my other TV from a famous brand that costs 4X the price of my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV.  I'm impressed!HDMI & CONNECTIVITYI'm only using HDMI1 because all my content is streamed and I have been using an Amazon Firestick, and Google Chromecast.  The Chromecast is plugged into HDMI1, and the TV automatically switches to it when you want to use it.  However, I don't think I'll be using the Chromecast much, because Fire TV is so good, and has an amazing remote control.I'm also using a 2TB External hard drive plugged into the fast USB.  Playing movies, even in HD, is a perfect experience with no lag or juddering.Access to the sockets on the wall-mounted TV is OK if you have small arms, and although I'm only using HDMI1, Optical Audio Out and one USB, there is plenty of connectivity for other equipment.JUST ONE THING...This version of FireTV only allows Alexa to speak 2 languages, viz. English (Indian), or Hindi.My Amazon Firestick, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo, and Echo Dot all have settings for English UK, Aus, USA, etc, Spanish, French, German, and many other languages.  I really would like to use Alexa on my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV in my native language - it makes it easier for Alexa to understand me, and easier for me to understand Alexa.I hope that this will come in a software update.CONCLUSIONI think that this 55 inch Amazon Fire TV is amazing, and I would recommend it without hesitation.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51z60rNcKSL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-108cm-inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B087JWLZ2K/ref=sr_1_493?qid=1672909149&s=electronics&sr=1-493,61,2024-09-11,2024,9,11,3050000.0,2024-09-11

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the ""Alert slider"" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.Ã°ÂÂÂ,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iEc0hf6TL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Jade-256GB-Storage/dp/B0B3D39RKV/ref=sr_1_75?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-75,12,2024-10-25,2024,10,25,407988.0,2024-10-25

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes Ã¢ÂÂ but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement Ã¢ÂÂ which is entirely non-negotiable Ã¢ÂÂ is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf Ã¢ÂÂ primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an Ã¢ÂÂimmersive listening experienceÃ¢ÂÂ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers Ã¢ÂÂ because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone Ã¢ÂÂ but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is SamsungÃ¢ÂÂs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentProsÃÂ Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloadingÃÂ  of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like aÃÂ screen recorder,ÃÂ video call effects, Game Launcher,ÃÂ Link to Windows,ÃÂ Dual Messenger,ÃÂ Quick Share,ÃÂ Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability toÃÂ change the color paletteÃÂ of icons and menus based on the wallpaper andÃÂ dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included.Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,ÃÂ  signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performsÃÂ  more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good rangeÃÂ  no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job .Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may notExcellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt SamsungÃ¢ÂÂs chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runConsÃÂ Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4kÃÂ Amoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but weÃÂ  can expect exynos 1280ÃÂ  to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition",HTTPS://M.MEDIA-AMAZON.COM/IMAGES/I/419KF2T1NML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.JPG,https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Emerald-Storage-Purchased-Separately/dp/B0B14MR9L1/ref=sr_1_80?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-80,49,2025-10-14,2025,10,14,1224951.0,2025-10-14

Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,Ã°ÂÂÂ¥ Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen Ã°ÂÂÂ± issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.Ã°ÂÂÂ¥ 15 Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¯Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â¨ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¥Â¤Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¨ Ã°ÂÂÂ± Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â-Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â°Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â¹ Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¤ Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¢Ã Â¤Â¼Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â-Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Âª Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¯ Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¡ Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¶ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¡Ã Â¤Â¼Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¥Â¤Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¤Â® Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â­Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤ÂµÃ Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â² Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¯Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â²Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¨ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¸ Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¤ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â¨ Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¡Ã Â¤Â¼Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â² Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¦Ã Â¤Â²Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â¡Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â«Ã Â¤Â° Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â¹ Ã Â¤Â¬Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¤ Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â¨ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂµÃ Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â²Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â® Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â° Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¸ Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â·Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¢Ã Â¤Â¼ Ã Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â¹Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â¾ Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¼Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¨ Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â§Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¯Ã Â¤Â® Ã Â¤Â¸Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â° Ã Â¤Â¦Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls.

Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,Its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. I still give it a 3.7 stars as battery Ã°ÂÂÂ could be better. It also looses a point for not including a charger.,Phone looks are good. The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original. Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP, total lied about 108 MP. Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy. Other brands have better and smoother UI.,Phone is very sleek, bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is....... Good budget model phone,you can not deny brand ,sumsung is a brand .overall good product for long use.,Good worck,Charger should have been part of it. But product looks good,Pricewise a little overpriced.Some of the cons are: a little rigid fingerprint sensor, after 2 months of use, i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone, battery life not up to the mark, struggles to go the entire day even with regular use, no 3.5 mm jack, and a buggy BT.Pros: a very good camera, excellent screen, superb sound quality.If you somehow get this for below 18k, then go for it or else there are better options available.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418vxJS4AML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-sAmoled-Purchased-Separately/dp/B09XJ5LD6L/ref=sr_1_333?qid=1672895842&s=electronics&sr=1-333,41,2025-02-13,2025,2,13,1352959.0,2025-02-13

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

A must buy for every person who is watch enthusiast.,Having a great experience","2 months review- its been working fine, there's been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I'll give it 9/10, it's good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven't understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can't check prove if that's correct.the water resistance, I haven't used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch Ã°ÂÂÂ,I've used this product for 4 days, and i'm going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don't get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super Ã°ÂÂÂ. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sHRWXCfvL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Fire-Boltt-Phoenix-Bluetooth-Calling-Monitoring/dp/B0B3RRWSF6/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1672902995&s=computers&sr=1-3,50,2025-05-30,2025,5,30,499950.0,2025-05-30

I wanted a wired earphone and when I searched on Amazon I found Boult in such a low price and I ordered it. Recieved it today.Checked it by connecting to my phone and I was surprised by the audio quality. This is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good. The build quality is average and you can't complain considering the price. It also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old Nokia days. It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So, it's quite new actually, not an old stock. It also has that anti-slip ear hook, which is an added advantage. In general, it is a good product for this price.,I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS:Ã¢ÂÂª Comfortable.Ã¢ÂÂª Elegant and sober appearance.Ã¢ÂÂª Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes.Ã¢ÂÂª Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue.Ã¢ÂÂª The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS:Ã¢ÂÂª Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the in-ear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.,Very Good Product, nicely fits in the ear and comfortable .The Volume seems to be a little low at the highest.But, A good Buy,Sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldn't hear the treble and other notes,very good bass quality And Worth for money earphones I ever Buy.. also Product Quality is awesome Ã°ÂÂÂ¥Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â,it doesn't fit as snugly in my ears, maybe it is cause of greasy ears, but the product is good, highly recommended,,Bolte audio bass is very good",HTTPS://M.MEDIA-AMAZON.COM/IMAGES/I/31DBAD6EOCL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMWEBP_.JPG,https://www.amazon.in/Boult-Audio-X1-Earphones-Cancellation/dp/B07TCN5VR9/ref=sr_1_28?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-28,79,2025-07-09,2025,7,9,78921.0,2025-07-09

It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does itÃ¢ÂÂs job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity.

When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.Ã¢ÂÂ This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.Ã¢ÂÂ This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã°ÂÂÂ CARRY POUCHÃ¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.Ã¢ÂÂ Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.Ã¢ÂÂ Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã°ÂÂÂ VERDICTÃ¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¶ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.Ã¢ÂÂ¶ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane Ã¢ÂÂ Honor Ã¢ÂÂ MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don't need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don't know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad's Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don't know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this.

So, I decided to buy this router to use as an access point. The setup is pretty straightforward, provided you know what you are doing.As is mentioned on the product page, this router comes with two modes -- router mode and access point mode. If you are using it in addition to your ISP provided modem-router, I would suggest using it in the access point mode only.The range and the speeds are working better than I expected for the price -- certainly better than the router that the ISP provides. The router does come with a LAN cable, but the quality of the cable is not very confidence inspiring. The LEDs on the front can be configured via the Tether app to switch off at specific times, which is a neat feature. Apart from that, I have found Tether app to be pretty useless. It doesn't specify the device identity for some reason, just shows the IP and ""unknown"", until you rename the device yourself. Sometimes it doesn't even list all the devices connected. I guess it is better to use the router settings from the browser itself if you want to dig into the settings.I would like to add one more thing in the end. This router looks pretty slick, and I don't think it has gotten enough credits for that. Kept on the table, or even hung from the wall, it looks and feels premium for the price -- and that is in addition to all the amazing features it has.,Router gets sometime auto disconnected even though it is connected to internet,I don't have any issue with router but sure with Amazon packaging method bcz no paper bag or anything were used it was only the box,Good product for that price. Good range,So far everything looks good, wIll update the review after a few months of usage!,Awasome experience, go for it with out any hasitation, assistance also very good.,Highly recommended to purchase, overall a good purchase, you will never regrate after purchasing it.,Signal strength can be improved further.So far good to go.

(boat says single tap tho)Conclusion - If you have a little more budget, don't buy this. else this just works fine.,I recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 181 in-Ear True Wireless Earbuds and have been using them for the past week. Overall, I am satisfied with the product. The earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit, and the sound quality is impressive for the price point.However, I was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised. While they do block out some ambient noise, they are not as effective as other earbuds I've used with noise cancellation technology.The battery life has been satisfactory. The earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge, and the case is convenient for charging on the go.Overall, I would recommend the boAt Airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budget-friendly option with good sound quality. Just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation.,I am writing this review after two days of usage.1. Sound Quality: The lows are good and pleasing to the ears. Bass quality is good. I just felt like the treble is a little too high which makes the high frequency music sound a bit unpleasant. Overall the quality is okay but not as good as a wired headset or neckband earphones. (Kaam chal jayga)2. Battery Backup: It's been 2 days and I haven't charged it yet....still showing 70+% of battery remaining. So I don't think battery backup would be a problem. (moderate usage)3. Built: The case is small and handy. It feels sturdy. The buds fit well in the ears. Overall built is good.4. Latency: This one's for gamers. I am actually impressed by the low latency it has. Even without turning on the 'Beast Mode', the feedback is almost instantaneous. And after turning on the Beast mode, it becomes flawless. I played BGMI and COD and didn't feel any lag in the sound.5. Calling: I tried calling in a silent atmosphere and there was no problem faced. Will update you guys if there turns out to be a problem when calling in a crowded area.,In 1399 rupees it is a good earphones. Good battary life, good sound, good connectivityCons- very poor build quality, feel so cheap. If you r a choosy person then you don't like the product.,If you're looking for wireless earphone under 1500 go for it. This product is good the sound leakage is there no doubt but you won't feel any sort of distortion,the airdrops 181 are very handy, compact in size ,long lasting battery for its size and the connectivity is is pretty good along with the sound quality , though it has a room for improvement in noise cancellation but still performs very well for this price point.,Its a good product sound quality is also agood but noise cancellation is average,It is good product but only for 4-5 months.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/314g1W9h2rL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg, https://www.amazon.in/Airdopes-181-Playtime-Bluetooth-Wireless/dp/B09PL79D2X/ref=sr_1_116?qid=1672903000&s=computers&sr=1-116 ,41,2025-12-09,2025,12,9,122590.0,2025-12-09

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so there's that!Verdict: Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what it's worth.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31luFfya0kL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Redgear-Gaming-Semi-Honeycomb-Windows-Gamers/dp/B08CHZ3ZQ7/ref=sr_1_177?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-177,52,2024-11-23,2024,11,23,0.0,2024-11-23

Same story repeated again,for 8 months the original one worked and the replacement worked for 3 months.It is a good charger if you want to use it as an alternative to apple, however remember that it costs 1/4th so it also works for 1/4th the life.

It came out while adjusting...wastage of money,Nice product,Good,A Must Have product.,Poor sound,Wothy,Useful product if you watch movies in mobile.","Super product,Worst product,Too good product,Good,Since long I was waiting for someone to manufacture a simple mobile set of pocket radio size so that I could listen online stations with reasonable sound quality.  As we know  what ever qualities a modern mobile set may have, the audio produced by it is always dry with no bass content.  So either we have to connect it to a music system or have to use headphones which are harmful to ears in the long run. Recently when I was surfing internet I saw this product which looked like an old radio.  On verifying the details I found this fulfills my requirement and without delay I placed order.Zebronics Astra 10 is having excellent audio quality with sufficient bass and treble content  just  like radios of olden days. The hollow space around the speaker adds to the bass  effect.  If we rotate the set and make the speaker to face us, the sound becomes more crisp.  Even with full volume  sound does not distort.Bluetooth connectivity also is marvelous  and connects within no time and there are no breaks and delay in audio transmission.  Battery backup also appears to be good.  After fully charging once I am using it daily and after 3 days still it is showing 80% charge.  Though there is no provision to know the remaining charge in the product, the mobile from which we are connecting bluetooth  shows the details.Normally we can not expect much from FM Radio in such type of gadgets. But this product is exception for that.  By attaching a small wire to the whip antenna I could listen FM station situated 200 KM away as if was local one.Aux, USB and mSD card facilities also work well.But I felt the on/off switch should have been some what sturdy.  Long press type button would have been a better option. Also scanning of FM stations  should have been on long press instead of single press to avoid accidental scanning.Over all it is a great product.To give it a nostalgic look while enjoying online radio,  I used the picture of our old National Ekco Radio's tuning dial as the home screen of the mobile.I use this for personl TV audio listening as well.Chidambar KakathkarMangalore,Poor sound quality,Worthy,You cant use it if the mobile is slim or more petite. I bought this for my mom; her mobile is a slim model and doesn't have a case, and the mobile keeps falling if you tilt it. Overall it is a good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uoxHxPDaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/ZEBRONICS-Zeb-Astra-Wireless-Portable-Function/dp/B08S74GTBT/ref=sr_1_495?qid=1672903019&s=computers&sr=1-495,83,2025-11-06,2025,11,6,165917.0,2025-11-06

OTHER THAN THAT, FINE PRODUCT,2500 SE JYADA PRICE NAHI HONA CHAHIYE THA. USE KARNE MEIN BAHUT ACHHA HAI,OVER ALL I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE PRODUCT AND ESPECIALLY COOKING EXPERIENCE. I WAS USED TO NORMAL GAS AND IT WAS EASY TO REGULATE TO PROPPER TEMPERATURE. THIS PRODUCT HAS ONLY LIKE 8 TEMPERATURE SETTINGS AND IT IS EITHER TOO HOT OR TOO COLD AND CANNOT BE SET IN MIDDLE. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I SET 160ÃÂ°C THEN IT IS BURNING TOASTS AND ONIONS... WHEN I SET ONE STEP LOWER IT IS 130ÃÂ°C AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR FRYING :(((.ALSO YOU NEED TO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE INDUCTION FRIENDLY COOKWARE. AND EVEN WHEN I INVEST TO EXPENSIVE TEFAL PAN IT HEAT MOSTLY IN THE CENTER AND IT IS MUCH COLDER ON THE EDGES... YOU CAN SEE ON PICTURES THAT WATTER BOILING ONLY IN MIDDLE, AND TOAST BEING BURNT IN MIDDLE AND RAW OUTSIDE :((( THE PAN IS VERY GOOD AND HAS INDUCTION AREA OVER WHOLE BOTTOM SO I'M SURE THE FAULT IS IN THIS PHILIPS STOVE... YOU CAN SEE THE PAN FROM BOTTOM THAT INDUCTION AREA IS ALMOST OVER WHOLE BOTTOM... ALSO DUE TO FACT THAT ONLY CENTER IS HOT THEN FRYING ONIONS IS TAKING MUCH LONGER THAN ON NORMAL GAS STOVE WHERE HEAT IS BETTER DISTRIBUTED :((( AND EVEN THOUGH YOU SPENT MORE TIME FRYING THE ONIONS THE RESULT IS WORSE... ONION IS LITTLE BURNED FROM OUTSIDE AND STILL NOT SOFT INSIDE... I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY FRYING EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO GAS STOVE...THERE IS ONE POSITIVE SIDE AND THAT IS THAT HEATING IS QUICK. MY PRESSURE COOKER STAR WHISTLING QUITE QUICKLY. FASTER THAN ON GAS STOVE. ALSO YOU CAN SET TIME FOR LIKE 10 MINUT AND LEAVE IT WHICH IS QUITE CONVENIENT...CONTROLL IS EASY. BUT I HATE DETAILS. FIRST I LOVE ONE DETAIL. THERE IS ""PAUSE"" BUTTON WHICH IS VERY COOL. IF SOMETHING HEATS TOO QUICKLY OR YOU JUST NEED TO QUICKLY DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU PRESS PAUSE BUTTON AND THERE IS NO NEW HEAT - IT IS MUCH NICER COMPARED TO GAS STOVE WHERE YOU WOULD NEED TO TURN OFF, LIGHT UP AGAIN AND THEN FIND RIGHT FLAME AGAIN... HERE YOU JUST PRESS PAUSE AGAIN AND COOK AS BEFORE... BUT THAT IS ONLY THING THAT I LOVE. OTHERWISE I HATE HOW IT IS DESIGNED.... FIRST BASICLLY WHOLE TOP ROW OF BUTTONS IS USELESS. THOSE BUTTONS ARE PRESET TEMPERATURES. BUT ANYWAY THOSE TEMPERATURES ARE WRONG OR JUST FOR ITEMS YOU DO NOT COOK... LIKE THERE IS 'STIRR FRY' BUTTON AND IT SET 180C. IT TOTALLY BURNS ONION... I SET USUALLY 180C FOR BEGINNING AND THEN SOON CHANGE FOR 160C. BUT EVEN 160C IS TOO MUCH BURNING... BUT LOWER SETTING IS ONLY 130C WHICH IS NOT FRYING AT ALL. I WOULD NEED LIKE 150C I GUESS AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET :((( ...ALSO I NOTICED ANOTHER ISSUE THAT STOVE IS SOMETIMES MAKING AUTOMATIC PAUSES. IT HEATS AND THAN PROBABLY WHEN IT THINKS IT IS TOO HOT THEN IT STOP COMPLETELLY AND IN LIKE 10 SECONDS STARTS AGAIN. SO INSTEAD OF CONSISTENTN TEMPERATURES IT IS DOING ON AND OFF.BUT BACK TO CONTROLL. EXCEPT FROM FACT THAT PRESET TEMPERATURES ARE USELESS WHEN YOU WANT TO CHANGE TEMPERATURE IT WON'T LET YOU OR LET YOU TO DO ONLY ONE '-' BUT NOT 2 TIMES '-'. WHY??? I DON'T KNOW PROBABLY ILL WILL... YOU NEED TO FIRST PRESS ""MANUAL"" BUTTON WHICH CHANGE TEMPERATURE COMPLETELY TO 130C AND ONLY THEN YOU CAN FREELY PRESS +/- AND SET YOUR DESIRED TEMPERATURE. SO BASICALLY I NEVER USE ANY PRESET MODE AND I ALWAYS ONLY PRESS 'MANUAL' AND +/- TO SET MY TEMPERATURE...ANOTHER CONTROL IS SETTING TIME. I MUST SAY SATTING TIME IS USEFUL FEATURE AND I LOVE IT, BUT HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED I HATE. WHEN YOU PRESS TIME BUTTON THEN BY DEFAULT IT SET 30 MINUTES... OK BUT WHEN YOU HOLD '-' BUTTON IT JUMPS SO QUICKLY THAT IN ONE SECOND IT COUNTS TO 0 AND ROLL TO 3 HOURS.... HOLDING INCREMENT/DECREMENT IS SO QUICK THAT IT IS USELESS. IT MUST HAVE IMPLEMENT SOME IDIOT... ANYWAY YOU CAN ALWAYS CLICK ONE BY ONE. SO TO SET 10 MINUTES YOU MUST CLICK 'TIME' BUTTON AND THEN CLICK 20 TIMES 'MINUS' BUTTON TO SET 10 MINUTES... IT IS DOABLE BUT PRETTY ANNOYING. OR I LONG PRESS '-' IT USIALLY JUMPS DIRECTLY TO 3 HOURS AND THEN I PRESS 11 TIMES +...  STILL ANOYING BUT I SAVE LIKE 8 CLICKS... WHAT IS SUPER IDIOTIC IS THAT WHEN I WANT TO ADD 5 MINUTES I CLICK TIME AND IT BY DEFAULT SET 30 MINUTES AGAIN :(((( ARRRRGGGHHHHH.... SO INSTEAD OF JUST CLICK TIME AND 5 TIMES '+' I NEED TO CLICK 25 TIMES '-' :((((.... REALLY THIS MUST HAVE DONE SOME IDIOT.... ANOTHER UNPLEASANT THING IS THAT IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE TEMPERATURE YOU CAN NOT... IMAGINE SOMETHING STARTS BURNING AND YOU NEED TO WAIT LIKE 3 SECONDS AND NOT PRESSING '-'/'+' AND THEN AFTER THOSE 3 SECONDS TIME SETTING MODE IS AUTOMATICALLY LEFT AND IT WILL LET YOU CHANGE TEMPERATURES AGAIN... WHEN CONTROLLING  STUPIDITY IS BURNING MY FOOD IT MAKES ME ANGRY :((((SO OVER ALL I WOULD BUY ANYTHING ELSE NEXT TIME... MAYBE IT WILL BE WORSE BUT I WOULD AT LEAST TRY...ANYWAY TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE AT THE END I LIKE THAT PRODUCT LOOKS QUITE DURABLE AND MATERIAL QUALITY LOOKS GOOD. PACKAGING WAS ALSO WELL. BUT POWER CABLE IS ONLY LIKE 1.2 METERS.... THAT MIGHT BE TOO SHORT... BUT FOR ME JUST ENOUGH... ALSO I LIKE MECHANIC BUTTONS, SOME STOVE HAS CAPACITY BUTTONS WHICH IS COOL LOOKING AND TOTALLY FLAT BUT I LIKE TO FEEL THE PRESS AND THE CLICK. BUTTONS ARE UNDER FOIL SO THERE IS NO RISK OF SOMETHING LEAKING INTO THEM. CLEANING IS VERY EASY COS IT IS ALMOST FLAT :) CLEANING EXPERIENCE IS MUCH BETTER THAN CLEANING GAS STOVE...,PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT SERVICE CENTER PROBLEM NOT AVAILABLE NEARLY.,NO1,Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â² Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â® Ã Â¤ÂÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â Ã Â¤ÂªÃ Â¤Â°Ã Â¥ÂÃ Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¥Â,ORDERED 3 ONE WAS FAULTY",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Bnylq337S._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Philips-Collection-HD4928-01-2100-Watt/dp/B00EDJJ7FS/ref=sr_1_54?qid=1672923593&s=kitchen&sr=1-54,82,2024-08-03,2024,8,3,434190.0,2024-08-03

Unfortunately this product doesn't have that option and my purchase went for a complete waste.,First things firstIt's not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth.However, the unit I received had one major, or rather fatal, issue. Current was passing through its entire body, be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back. You can't hold it without getting an electric shock when it's running. If you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another, you would need to unplug it from the power source first. Otherwise it can be fatal. If you use it in the night, you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else, you might accidentally touch it and die. Homes with children needs to be extra protective.Now I am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or a general problem with these type of heaters. I have requested a replacement, let's see how the replacement unit works. I'll update the review accordingly.,in my heater one rod is not working then i call the bajaj customer care number it is given in pamphlet then a person came from bajaj and my issue solved",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41WyoT08raL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Bajaj-Delux-2000-Watt-Room-Heater/dp/B009P2LK80/ref=sr_1_103?qid=1672923596&s=kitchen&sr=1-103,53,2024-04-19,2024,4,19,86867.0,2024-04-19

It works like a magic so easy and so quick. The blender is also good. I using it almost every day for my juice and milkshakes.

After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support, its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service , as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent.,Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services, we will be charged.

Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 .

Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box, you can start yourself without waiting.In the box: 10 disposable mops, 1 washable mops, 2 side brushes, 1 main brush, Mopping plate, Deebot, Dust chamber with HEPA filter, Charging Dock, Cable, User Manual, Cleaning BrushCleaning performance: Superb cleaning with 4 power options - Quiet, Normal, Max and Max+. Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (Good if you have children in the house). Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or Spiral)Mopping Performance: The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage - Low, Medium, High, Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High (The robot may slip due to water on the floor) but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad (As it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)Corner Cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don't have straight walls (E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).Corner Mopping: As the Deebot's mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture, Black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot's Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (Divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)The created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). You have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot's laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area). Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (Similar to Virtual boundary).Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can't be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning (Select a room or multiple rooms to clean), Auto clean (Clean the entire house), Custom Cleaning (Select an area on the map to clean).You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). You can also preset how many times (Options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to Max+). You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes (if needed), Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas). Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range, I am very satisfied with the performance.,",HTTPS://M.MEDIA-AMAZON.COM/IMAGES/W/WEBP_402378-T2/IMAGES/I/31LY7OEHCGL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMWEBP_.JPG,https://www.amazon.in/ECOVACS-Robotic-Powerful-Advanced-Technology/dp/B0B19VJXQZ/ref=sr_1_323?qid=1672923609&s=kitchen&sr=1-323,95,2024-07-02,2024,7,2,5690500.0,2024-07-02

I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes Ã¢ÂÂ but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement Ã¢ÂÂ which is entirely non-negotiable Ã¢ÂÂ is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf Ã¢ÂÂ primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an Ã¢ÂÂimmersive listening experienceÃ¢ÂÂ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers Ã¢ÂÂ because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone Ã¢ÂÂ but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is SamsungÃ¢ÂÂs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentProsÃÂ Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloadingÃÂ  of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like aÃÂ screen recorder,ÃÂ video call effects, Game Launcher,ÃÂ Link to Windows,ÃÂ Dual Messenger,ÃÂ Quick Share,ÃÂ Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.,Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine. I liked it and i think you also love it if your budget is in this range.,First fall I was take as buy a acer tv, then I have fear because acer tv is new brand and if any problem with tv serving. But after purchased and  using my fear was goes. Because tv functions is good. And warranty also available.,Overall its a  good product, some times it lags and once it got auto restarted.but company has lied to customers with that there is 16 gb of space in the TV which is not therestill i like the picture and sound quality,I am very happy when I order this tv. I have purchased it on Diwali. When we start to use this tv, we found that to use the cromecast feature I need to install a third party app which is not support to my mobile phone (samsung M21). I am very disappointed now  for this feature but what can i do now. It has good and loud sound system. My overall experience is not meet to my expectations.,I regret not having gotten a larger size. This is an amazing smart tv, clear view and awesome sound. 4 stars only because I couldnt get jio universal remote to work with it.,Under 15k best smart Android TV everything is perfect  like sound, picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and wifi.

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 Ã¢ÂÂ¦,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop donÃ¢ÂÂt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/21jLkYGoSEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-LINK-T3U-Wireless-MU-MIMO-Supports/dp/B0859M539M/ref=sr_1_160?qid=1672909131&s=electronics&sr=1-160,65,2024-05-06,2024,5,6,194935.0,2024-05-06
